This directory (DRIP_WenTadmor_2018_C__MO_000000111111_000) contains a
Dihedral-angle-corrected registry-dependent interlayer potential (DRIP) Model
for carbon.

The DRIP potential for carbon only provides a description of the interlayer
interactions of multilayer graphene structures. To give a full description of
the interactions of multilayer graphene structures, it needs to be used together
with another potential that provides the intralayer descriptions (e.g. Tersoff,
and REBO).

The DRIP potential for carbon is described in the following references:
1. M. Wen, S. Carr, S. Fang, E. Kaxiras, and E. B. Tadmor, "Dihedral-angle-corrected
   registry-dependent interlayer potential for multilayer graphene structures",
   Phys. Rev. B, submitted.
